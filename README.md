# Requiem2_0_2_JP

Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281).

These files are unofficial japanese translations of Requiem 2.0.2, which is based on the Requiem 1.9.4.1 日本語版 (see Credits). 

You can copy, edit, and redistribute these files in the restrict of the original Skyrim license and cyclotron.moe.hm.

A machine translation is **not** used for added sentences in Requiem 2.x. However, I don't know whether machine translations had been used in  works of Requiem 1.x Japanese.
