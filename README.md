# Requiem2_0_2_JP

Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281).

This file will be a Requiem 2.0.2 Japanese translation, which is based on the Requiem 1.9.4.1 日本語版 (see Copyrights). 

Machine translation is **not** used for added sentences in Requiem 2.x. However, I don't know whether machine translation was used in works of Requiem 1.x Japanese.
